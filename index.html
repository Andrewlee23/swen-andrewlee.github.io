<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Andrew Lee and I attended Seoul Foreign School in Seoul, South Korea. I've been living in korea basically my entire life and it's my first time in the united states. My hobbies include gaming, tabletop games, and coding in c++. I also enjoy listening to music artists such as Camellia, Egoist, Yoasobi, and other J-pop artists, as well as random Kpop groups as well.</p>
